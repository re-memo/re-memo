# re:memo

> AI-assisted journaling that helps you remember, reflect, and grow

**re:memo** is a privacy-focused AI journaling application that transforms your thoughts into structured insights while keeping your data under your control. Built during a 30-hour hackathon, it combines the intimacy of personal journaling with the power of AI to help you understand patterns in your life, remember important details, and gain deeper self-awareness.

## üåü Motivation

- In our fast-paced world, we often lose track of our thoughts, experiences, and personal growth. Traditional journaling is powerful but can feel overwhelming - where do you start? What should you write about? How do you find patterns in months of entries?

**re:memo** solves these problems by:

- **Removing the blank page problem** with AI-powered writing prompts based on your history
- **Extracting meaningful insights** from your stream-of-consciousness writing
- **Creating a searchable memory palace** of your experiences and growth
- **Respecting your privacy** with local AI options and full data control
- **Making reflection effortless** through intelligent suggestions and chat-based exploration

> [!NOTE]
> re:memo is designed with privacy as a first-class citizen. You can run everything locally or choose hybrid setups based on your comfort level with external services.

## üöÄ Key Features

### Core Features

- [x] **Markdown Journal Editor** - Write with live preview, just like Obsidian
- [x] **AI-Powered Processing** - Automatically extract events, facts, and insights from entries
- [x] **Smart Topic Suggestions** - Get personalized writing prompts based on your history
- [x] **Intelligent Search** - Vector-based search to find relevant entries and memories
- [x] **Chat with Your Journal** - Ask questions about your past entries and get AI responses
- [x] **Privacy-First Design** - Optional local LLM support with Ollama
- [x] **Docker Deployment** - One-command setup with docker-compose
- [x] **Entry Review System** - AI-generated insights and connections to past entries

> [!TIP]
> The vector search allows you to find entries by meaning, not just keywords. Ask "when was I feeling anxious about work?" instead of searching for specific terms.

### üîÑ In Development

- [ ] **Voice Journaling** - Speak your thoughts, get structured journal entries
- [ ] **Advanced Fact Management** - Smart handling of changing preferences and contradictions
- [ ] **Rich Text Search** - Full-text fuzzy search across all journal entries

### üéØ Future Enhancements

- [ ] **Insights Dashboard** - Visualize emotions, themes, and growth over time
- [ ] **Habit Tracking Integration** - Connect journal insights with behavior patterns
- [ ] **Export & Backup** - Multiple format exports (PDF, Markdown, JSON)
- [ ] **Mobile App** - React Native companion app
- [ ] **Advanced Privacy** - End-to-end encryption options
- [ ] **Collaboration Features** - Share insights with therapists or coaches (opt-in)

> [!NOTE]
> Feature development prioritizes user privacy and data ownership. Community feedback shapes our roadmap.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python Quart (async Flask)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector for embeddings
- **AI/ML**:
  - LLMs: Ollama (local) or OpenAI-compatible APIs
  - Embeddings: HuggingFace sentence-transformers
- **Deployment**: Docker + Docker Compose

> [!NOTE]
> The architecture supports both local-first deployment and cloud-hybrid setups. pgvector enables efficient similarity search across journal entries.

## üí° How It Works

1. **Write Naturally** - Use the markdown editor to journal however feels comfortable
2. **AI Processing** - When you mark an entry complete, AI extracts key facts, events, and topics
3. **Build Your Memory** - Facts are stored as searchable embeddings in your personal database
4. **Get Suggestions** - Next time you write, get personalized prompts based on your history
5. **Chat & Explore** - Ask questions about your past entries through the chat interface

> [!TIP]
> The system learns your writing patterns and personal topics over time. The more you write, the better it gets at providing relevant prompts and insights.

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Daily Reflection** - Process your day with AI-guided prompts
- **Therapy Support** - Structured self-reflection between sessions
- **Creative Writing** - Explore themes and patterns in your creative process
- **Goal Tracking** - Monitor progress and mindset changes over time
- **Memory Palace** - Never lose important thoughts or realizations
- **Personal Research** - Chat with your past self to find insights

> [!NOTE]
> Many users find re:memo particularly helpful for identifying emotional patterns and tracking personal growth over extended periods.
